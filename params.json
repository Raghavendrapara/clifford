{"name":"Clifford","tagline":"Clifford algebra for CAS Maxima","body":"### Clifford algebra for CAS Maxima\r\n\r\nClifford algebra a lightweight package for performing Geometric Algebra calculations.\r\nWilliam Clifford invented his algebras in 1876 as an attempt to generalize the quaternions to higher dimensions.\r\nIt unifies all branches of physics, and has found rich applications in robotics, signal processing, ray tracing, virtual reality, computer vision, vector field processing, tracking, geographic information systems and neural computing. \r\n\r\n[Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series, Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear equations, polynomials, sets, lists, vectors, matrices and tensors. Maxima yields high precision numerical results by using exact fractions, arbitrary-precision integers and variable-precision floating-point numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and three dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe package was inspired by the atensor package for Maxima (courtesy to [Viktor Toth] (http://www.vttoth.com/CMS/projects/61-the-maxima-computer-algebra-system)).\r\n \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTo run the package clone the repository and add the folder to Maxima by executing commands\r\n\r\nfile_search_demo: append (file_search_demo,[\"/path/to/folder\"]);\r\n\r\nfile_search_maxima: append (file_search_maxima,[\"/path/to/folder\"]);\r\n\r\nThen  you can run a demo by typing\r\ndemo(\"clifford.dem\");","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
